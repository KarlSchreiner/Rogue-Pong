## power up ideas

regenerating health -> if player uses this the player would need to sit still. If the ai used this it would be cool for a boss

we could put objects in the middle. likely will get stuck and bounce around for a bit. That's a feature.

click power ups to drive player engagmenet

## upgrade ideas

//it's a shop where the upgrades are random

custom enemey sound for each enemey

stops moving --focus points // do a check every second. 1/10 chance to stop
speed paddle can move
width of paddle

money printer upgrade-- prints coins on screen when ball hits coin you get upgrade money printer to get more coins

health

slow down region //continuos
hole in paddle // activated lasts x seconds // how long it stays and how many uses

spawn in more balls
One sided balls

more paddles // each paddle locks on to next ball
zombie paddle
stationary paddle //potentially has health

## backend

how close you made it or completion time

game state how much money you have what round you are on what upgrades you have name of save

get new upgrade choices endpoint

purchased upgrade endpoint

start round endpoint

round end endpoint

## Tickets

## Dev Commands

- Create new React Component in the components folder: `npx generate-react-cli component <TypeComponentNameHere>`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
